# ⚠️ RESTART REQUIRED

## Large File Support Has Been Implemented

I've made changes to handle large markdown files (over 1MB), but **you need to restart your development server** for the changes to take effect.

## How to Restart

### Step 1: Stop Current Server

In your terminal where `npm run dev` is running:

**Press:** `Ctrl + C` (or `Cmd + C` on Mac)

### Step 2: Start Server Again

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Try Saving Again

Go back to your chapter editor and try saving your large markdown file.

## What Was Fixed

### ✅ Server Configuration
- **Increased body size limit** to 10MB (from default ~1MB)
- **Updated Vite config** for larger chunks
- **Optimized server settings**

### ✅ Client-Side Improvements
- **Real-time size monitoring** - See file size as you type
- **Smart warnings** - Alert if file is > 5MB
- **Better error handling** - Clearer error messages
- **Loading indicator** - Shows "Saving..." during upload

### ✅ User Experience
- **Size indicator** - Bottom right of editor shows current size
- **Color coding:**
  - Gray: < 1MB (Safe)
  - Yellow: 1-5MB (Warning)
  - Red: > 5MB (Too Large)

## Current Limits

After restarting, you should be able to save:
- ✅ Up to **10MB** per chapter
- ✅ Large markdown content
- ✅ Extensive LaTeX equations

## Best Practices

Even with increased limits, consider:

1. **Keep chapters under 2MB** for best performance
2. **Split very large content** into multiple chapters
3. **Use external links** for large images/PDFs
4. **Monitor the size indicator** while editing

## Troubleshooting

### Still Getting 431 Error?

If you still see the error after restarting:

1. **Verify server restarted:**
   ```bash
   # Check terminal output
   # Should show: Server started at http://localhost:3000
   ```

2. **Clear browser cache:**
   - Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (or `Cmd + Shift + R`)
   - Or clear cache in browser settings

3. **Check file size:**
   - Look at size indicator in editor
   - If > 10MB, you'll need to split the content

4. **Try smaller content first:**
   - Save a small test edit
   - Gradually add more content

### Content Still Too Large?

If your content is > 10MB:

**Option 1: Split Into Multiple Chapters**
```
Instead of: Chapter 1 (15MB)
Do: Chapter 1a (5MB) + Chapter 1b (5MB) + Chapter 1c (5MB)
```

**Option 2: Use External Resources**
```markdown
# Link to external PDFs/documents
[Full Content (PDF)](https://your-site.com/content.pdf)

# Or use cloud storage
[Additional Resources](https://drive.google.com/...)
```

**Option 3: Optimize Content**
- Remove embedded images → use external links
- Remove duplicate content
- Compress whitespace
- Split into sections

## Quick Check

After restarting, you should see:

1. ✅ Size indicator in bottom right of editor
2. ✅ Size changes as you type
3. ✅ Color changes (gray → yellow → red) based on size
4. ✅ Warning dialog if file > 5MB
5. ✅ "Saving..." message when submitting
