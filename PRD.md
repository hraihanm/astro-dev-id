That’s actually a **great and very realistic project**, not too complicated if you start small. You can think of it as building a **personal MOOC platform** — like a cross between LibreTexts (for content), Moodle (for quizzes), and Wikipedia (for easy editing).

Below is a **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** you can copy-paste into Cursor or BMAD to kickstart planning and architecture generation.

## 📘 Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Project Name:** My Learning Portal (MLP)
**Author:** Hammam Raihan Mohammad
**Version:** 0.1 (MVP draft)
**Date:** 2025-10-24

---

### 1. Overview

My Learning Portal (MLP) is a self-hosted **e-learning website** designed for instructors to manage and deliver structured learning content and quizzes.
It focuses on **LaTeX-based course materials** (for science/astronomy content), **modular structure** like LibreTexts, and **offline-first use** (usable in training sessions with local hosting).

---

### 2. Goals

* ✅ Allow admin (teacher) to **create, edit, and organize course materials** in chapters/subchapters, supporting **Markdown + LaTeX**.
* ✅ Allow students to **register/login** and access materials and quizzes.
* ✅ Enable quizzes/exams written in **LaTeX**, supporting multiple-choice and written questions.
* ✅ Provide a simple **CMS-like editor** for updating course pages (like Wikipedia).
* ✅ Offline deployable on local server or LAN (e.g., during classroom sessions).

---

### 3. Future Goals (Post-MVP)

* 🔁 Progress tracking (completed chapters, scores)
* 📈 Analytics dashboard for instructors
* 📤 Import/export courses as Markdown/LaTeX bundles
* 👥 User roles: Admin, Instructor, Student
* 🧮 Math rendering improvements (KaTeX/MathJax)
* 🧩 Plugin system for custom question types
* 🎓 Certificates or grading system

### 6. Course Structure Concept

Example directory-style structure:

```
Course: "Introduction to Astronomy"
│
├── Chapter 1: Celestial Mechanics
│   ├── 1.1 Introduction.md
│   ├── 1.2 Kepler_Laws.md
│   └── quiz_1.json
│
├── Chapter 2: Stellar Evolution
│   ├── 2.1 Main_Sequence.md
│   ├── 2.2 Red_Giants.md
│   └── quiz_2.json
│
└── metadata.json
```

Each page supports LaTeX blocks and figures.
Each quiz file contains question sets, possibly parsed from Markdown or JSON-with-LaTeX.

---

### 7. Quiz Format Example

A simple example quiz definition (Markdown-based):

```markdown
# Quiz: Stellar Evolution

1. (5 pts) Compute the luminosity of a main-sequence star using:
   $$
   L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4
   $$

2. Multiple Choice:
   The triple-alpha process converts:
   - [ ] 2 Helium-4 nuclei to 1 Carbon-12
   - [x] 3 Helium-4 nuclei to 1 Carbon-12
   - [ ] 4 Helium-4 nuclei to 1 Oxygen-16
```

---

### 8. Admin Panel (MVP)

* Upload, edit, or delete Markdown/quiz files.
* Organize chapter hierarchy.
* Preview LaTeX rendering.
* Basic user management (reset password, assign roles).

---

### 9. Non-Goals (for MVP)

* No social/community features (forums, comments)
* No complex grading system. Just scoring based on multiple choices/complex multiple choices.
* No video streaming (embed links only)
* No external integrations (Moodle, LTI, etc.)

---

### 10. Architecture Sketch (conceptual)

```
[Frontend] React / Next.js
   ↕ API
[Backend] Node.js + Express
   ↕
[Database] SQLite
   ↕
[File Store] /courses/<course_id>/chapters/*.md
```

---

### 11. Development Plan (Phases)

**Phase 1: MVP**

* User login, admin dashboard
* Course + chapter CRUD
* Markdown + LaTeX rendering
* Basic quiz format

**Phase 2: Classroom Support**

* Offline mode packaging (Docker/desktop)
* Progress tracking per student

**Phase 3: Advanced**

* Grading automation
* Multi-instructor support
* Analytics dashboard

### 13. Notes

* The system should be **LaTeX-first**, meaning everything (text, equations, quizzes) should be compatible with MathJax rendering.
* Prefer **Markdown as storage** format for portability.
* Focus first on **offline usability** before scalability or analytics.
