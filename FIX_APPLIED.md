# Critical Fix Applied! âœ…

## The Problem

The API routes were being **prerendered as static pages**, which meant they couldn't:
- Access request headers
- Read cookies
- Process dynamic requests

This caused the error:
```
[WARN] `Astro.request.headers` is unavailable in "static" output mode
Content-Type was not one of "multipart/form-data" or "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
```

## The Solution

Added `export const prerender = false;` to **all API routes** to ensure they run server-side:

### Files Updated:
- âœ… `src/pages/api/auth/signin.ts`
- âœ… `src/pages/api/auth/signup.ts`
- âœ… `src/pages/api/admin/courses.ts`
- âœ… `src/pages/api/admin/quiz/create.ts`
- âœ… `src/pages/api/quiz/submit.ts`
- âœ… `src/pages/api/profile/update.ts`

### What This Does:
Forces these routes to be rendered **on-demand** on the server, giving them access to:
- Request headers (for Content-Type detection)
- Cookies (for authentication)
- Request body (for form data and JSON)

## ðŸš€ Next Step: RESTART DEV SERVER

**IMPORTANT**: You must restart the dev server for this to work!

### Steps:
1. **Stop the dev server**: Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal
2. **Start it again**: Run `npm run dev`
3. **Try signing up**: Go to `http://localhost:3000/auth/signup`

## Why Restart is Needed

The `prerender` configuration changes Astro's build process. Hot reload can update code, but it can't change how routes are rendered (static vs server-side).

## After Restart

Your signup should work perfectly:
1. Visit: `http://localhost:3000/auth/signup`
2. Enter:
   - Email: `raihan.muhamad@gmail.com`
   - Password: `raihan98`
3. Click "Create Account"
4. Should redirect to sign-in page âœ…

## Then Make Yourself Admin

```bash
npm run create-admin raihan.muhamad@gmail.com raihan98
```

Then sign in and access the admin dashboard!
