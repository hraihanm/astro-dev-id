I want to build an e learning site with login and I as the admin.

The user can access courses and quiz/exams.

The course is splitted by chapters just like in this site: https://phys.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Astronomy__Cosmology/Astronomy_1e_(OpenStax)

The content will be something like wikipedia, that admin can edit. It will mainly uses latex. I dont know if it is chapter by chapter, subchapter, etc, I dont really know about the structure just yet.

The quiz will also be in latex format, with several styles to be defined. Like, the numbering, the mc options, the subproblems, sub-subproblems, etc etc. But it's all in latex.

So, basically it is like MOOC maybe? Is there any open-source template for that?

It is more like a complete e-learning site, school information system maybe? but that's to ambitious.

So, please make some kind of PRD that I can throw to BMAD in cursor.


Is it too complicated?
Minimally i just want to have my online learning materials and quizzes available to my students when I train them in offline settings.
But later we can add more features
